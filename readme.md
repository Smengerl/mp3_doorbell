- Standalone Functionality: Fully functional doorbell without any need to build automations in home assistant
- Versatile Audio Output: Can be used as an audio output device for any Home Assistant automation, not limited to doorbell use.
- Custom Sounds: Play your own MP3 files as ringtone
- SD card support: Optional support to provide exchangeable ringtones via SD card or use streaming audio via a network player.
- Doorbell Light Support: Includes light effects when ringing.
- Home Assistant Integration: Exposes states and events via ESPHome, enabling triggers for automations.
- Low-Cost Hardware: Build the doorbell for approximately $10.
- Optional Power Supply: Separate 5V power supply with dual USB-C ports for usage with other DIN rail parts.
- Example Automations: Includes example code for triggering actions when door in rung like camera snapshots.

## Mechanics

The housing is the only mechanical part required for this project. It consists of a base and a side wall connected via screws. The case is designed to fit on a DIN rail and is secured with a hook.

There is a housing variant with SD card slot and one without which require slightly different electronics.

If you choose to build the optional 5V power supply, the same side wall and hook is used as for the doorbell case.

If you have the capabilities to print in multiple colors, you can optionally print labels for the screw connectors and the top of the case.

Printer settings:
- Material: PETG or PLA.
- Orientation: Print parts as shown in the thumbnails.
- Supports: Not required unless for the ESP mounting tips (use paint-on supports in your slicer).
- Rafts/Brims: Not required.

### Assembly

- Use hot glue to secure all electronic components (e.g., screw terminals, ESP32, DF Player) inside the housing after you have done the wiring.
- Attach the side wall to the base using six M3 5mm screws.
- Mount the case on the DIN rail and secure it with the hook.


## Electronics

If you want the user to be able to change the doorbell sound at runtime without recompiling, please build the variant with SD card (ESP doorbell I), otherwise build the simpler variant (ESP doorbell II). Further below I will show how the variant without SD card can be modified to use streamed doorbell sound.

All external connection are done via the screw connectors:
- Power supply is 5V DC and can be optionally build using the parts described herein (Be cautios, this is dangerous voltage level!). If you want to be on the safe side, buy a suitable standard DIN rail power supply from the shelf. Do not use your old fashioned bell transformer as this is AC!
- Can be connected directly to a single 8 Ohm speaker for output. No further amp required, also no resistors for volume regulation as output volume is controlled via SW.
- The bell button is a simple closing contact to ground with internal pullup.
- Optionally, an LED can be attached via GPIO output connected to ground, e.g. to light up the bell button at night. Please note that this is directly connected to GPIO of the ESP, so 5V don't draw too much current (should be sufficient for up to 4 standard LEDs though)!

## Usage

- Click in to DIN rain and secure via the hook
- Once powered on, adopt the device via ESP home
- Adapt it to your usage scenarios via home assistant (see examples below)


### MP3 doorbell

This most simple doorbell uses a build-in soundfile as ringtone. It's robust and has low latency as it the doorbell functionality works independently of Home Assistant. However, it also exposes entities for optional further automation.

This requires the box without SD card (ESP doorbell II).

Features:
- Fully functional standalone doorbell.
- Simple and robust
- Configurable volume via Home Assistant GUI.
- Exposes trigger for use in custom automations in home assistant
- Test buttons and diagnostics available in Home Assistant.

Find the sourcecode here: `./esphome_src/doorbell-sound.yaml`



### MP3 doorbell with SD card ringtones

This more advanced doorbell allows the user to provide their own ringtones via SD card. It's also robust and has low latency as it the doorbell functionality works independently of Home Assistant. However, it also exposes entities for optional further automation and allows to remote control the doorbell's audio player.

This requires the box with SD card (ESP doorbell I).

Features:
- Fully functional standalone doorbell.
- Configurable volume and sound via Home Assistant GUI.
- Exposes further entities for use in custom automations as generic SD card MP3 player
- Test buttons and diagnostics available in Home Assistant.
- DF player API provided to HA for even more flexible use in automations
- Watchdog to reset the DF Player if it hangs during playback.

Find the sourcecode here: `./esphome_src/doorbell-sound-sd-card.yaml`

Note: 
- DF player only supports certain SD cards and requires it to be formated in the right file system. See DF player documentation for details. 
- DF player plays the MP3 files on the SD card by the order of the FAT entry. Advising the player to play file #3 plays the third file that was written to the sd card - no matter of its filename or folder location.
- Most of the DF players I bought seem to have robustness issues as I saw them not responding every couple of months - which is bad for a doorbell. Ejecting and reinserting the SD card fixed the issue. 



### MP3 doorbell with streaming audio ringtones

This most flexible doorbell streams an audio file from a network source or the internet. Due to this, it is not as reliable and fast as the standalone variants as it requires a working network connection as well as ad-hoc download and decoding of the file. This variant also exposes several entities for optional further automation and allows to remote control the doorbell's audio player.

This requires the box without SD card (ESP doorbell II).

Features:
- Most flexible due to full audio streaming capability
- Can play network and internet sources or even web radio
- Configurable volume and sound via Home Assistant GUI.
- Exposes further entities for use in custom automations
- Test buttons and diagnostics available in Home Assistant.

Find the sourcecode here: `./esphome_src/doorbell-sound-streaming-audio.yaml`



### Camera snapshot

This example illustrates how to use the doorbell to trigger further actions via automations.
This could be as simple as switching the light on at the door in the dark. 
A more advanced usecase is shown here, which takes a snapshot of the visitor and interprets it via Gemini integration in order to send you a push notification.

For this, add and set up the Gemini integration in home assistant.

Using the following prompt you can interpret a camera image:
```
Very briefly describe what you see in the brick semi-circle area in front of my frontdoor in this image that was taken when the doorbell was rung.
Your message needs to be very short to fit in a phone notification and must not be longer than a single sentence. 
Don't describe stationary objects or buildings or vehicles in driveway. 
If you cannot identify people for sure, then tell me so. 
Otherwise tell me whether it seems to be visitors such as kids or a family or if it is a handcraftsman, a postman or a delivery man.  
Please don't describe their clothing. 
Please tell me if there is no one but there is a parcel or other item that they left at the door.
```

Example automation that uses this prompt and embedds it into a fully automated flow triggered when the doorbell is rung:
```yaml

- trigger: state

```
Note that his uses helper scripts not shown here to create and uptate push notification to mobile devices



### Home Reminder

As the doorbell provides an API with full control of the DF player, you can use this to play sounds on certain triggers via automations.
An example would be, to play a sound to not forget to switch off the lights when leaving home (e.g. when your front door contact is triggered).

For this, you can add to your SD card suitable sound effects or even prepare TTS output in MP3s (there are free tools on the internet to create such MP3s for predefined text input via TTS services).

```yaml
triggers:
- entity_id:
- binary_sensor.doorstate_frontdoor_contact
to: 'on'
id: start
for:
    hours: 0
    minutes: 0
    seconds: 5
from: 'off'
trigger: state
conditions: []
actions:
- action: esphome.doorbell_sound_dfplayer_play
data:
    file: 46
mode: single
```
