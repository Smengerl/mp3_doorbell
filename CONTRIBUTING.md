## Reporting issues

- Search existing issues before opening a new one.
- Provide clear steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior

## Coding style

- Follow commong coding style and best practice.
- Keep functions small and add comments for non-obvious logic.
- Keep print/stl, print/png folder structure when changing the mechanics (as used by my fusion plugins, see other project in my Github space)

## Testing
